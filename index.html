    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Daniel Kim and I graduated from the California State University of Fullerton in 2019 with a degree is business economics. 
            Despite my background in business, I have always been heavily interested in technology. 
            Thus, I decided to take the plunge and quit my job to pursue software engineering!
        </p>
    <h2>What I've Done</h2>
        <p>
            Like many others, I have had my fair share of random jobs that I didn't enjoy and that had nothing to with my major.
            Instead of talking about those, I'd like to share the story of my biggest success... my failed company.
            Prior to my last semester of college, one my closest friends asked me to do something crazy with him, create a dessert startup. 
            Our company "brûlée bites" was born. We sold individual bite size frozen cubes of crème brûlée with modern flavors. 
            Selling at a handful of farmers markets and one retail store while being in talks with more potential locations to sell, we were poised to continue growing at our slow yet steady rate, until COVID-19 happened.
            Ultimately, with no where to sell and diminishing funds, we decided to close this chapter of our lives, however, this experience made me realize that I want to continue creating products.

    <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p>
            I have a number of interests, but for now I'll just talk about one of them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of people know about and play Super Smash Brothers, but for my friends and I, we are all about Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Gamecube.
            Super Smash Brothers Melee, also known as "Melee" or "SSBM" came out in 2001. So yes, my friends and I choose to play a 20 year old game rather than any of its fancier descendants. 
            Melee has a complexity to it like no other game. The physics engine and mechanics allow for people to make the characters move in ways that most people theorize were never intended by the developers.
            This has led to the player community continuing to make advancements in the competetive scene for the last 20 years.
